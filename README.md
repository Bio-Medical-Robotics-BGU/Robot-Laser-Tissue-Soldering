# Robot-Laser-Tissue-Soldering
This repository contains MATLAB code used for generating figures and performing statistical data analysis as presented in our paper
"Bowel Incision Closure with a Semi-Automated Robot-Assisted Laser Tissue Soldering System". 
The data required for these analyses are provided in the CodeRLTS_.mat file which needs to be downloaded and placed in the working directory.

Step 1: Download the CodeRLTS_.mat File
Download the file from the link provided in the repository.
Place the file in the root directory of the MATLAB project.

Step 2: Running the Code
The MATLAB sections are organized such that each section corresponds to a specific figure or statistical analysis presented in the paper.
Each part of new data analysis in the file starrs with cleaning the data i.e. cleaning the workingspace and the command window. 
the next section is corresponding to a specific figure in the paper and the one after it corresponding to the statistical analysis for this figure
and so on for all figures that presants data analysis results.
